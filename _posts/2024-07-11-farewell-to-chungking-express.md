> During Scoot TR897 TPE ✈︎ SIN

On Friday of this week, I decided to watch [Wong Kar-Wai's "Chungking Express"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109424/) again in a long time. Chungking Express was in the background at an exhibition that I'd been recently, and I thought it would be nice to watch it again.

I read [Cheon Seon-Ran's essay "Anyway, Digimon: 'The Long and Very Short Summer Vacation Has Begun'"](https://www.yes24.com/campaign/onlyCremaclub/onlyCremaclub.aspx?Seqno=221250) during the flight. The author projects her own teenage loneliness and isolation onto Digimon. I lived with the same feelings throughout my teens and twenties, and as I read the essay, I realised that those feelings that I had was these two. I thought the cold Matthew from Digimon was cool. I even decided to go by that name for a few years. I'm sure the manga had a similar effect on me.

I loved everything about the essay, but I particularly resonated with the part about there being a whole other world where I could be totally okay. I didn't imagine I was the chosen one like the kids in Digimon, because I was a kid with such an old soul, but I still believed there was an answer in that other world, which is built with the language that is not inside in my brain. So every day, I repeated foreign words in my brain, weaving and stringing words together to create meaning. and I would spend all my time in a world of media from Tokyo or California, as if there was no truth here.

And my twenties, when I was a little bit of a grown-up, were just fully Chungking Express. I was as lonely as Ho Chi Moo, which is asking "Do you like pineapple?" in four languages. He seems to have expanded his reach by all the other languages, but in the end there is no one to meet. He misses May, but he makes no effort to see her again or to forget her. He is just acting stubborn, waiting for her voicemails, collecting and eating pineapples till the first of May.

As same as him, I was endlessly lonely and alone, but I was stubborn and unwilling to give in, and there were long periods when I thought it was the right way to go. I also thought that this was the least I could do since I was already putting in so much effort in my life outside of relationships. But thanks to good people and myself trying to be a better person, I now realise that it was all my immaturity. It's okay to trust people, and it's okay to ask the world for help even though I get scared.

Ho Chi Moo eventually decides to break free of his past, which is tied to May, only after he has done a good deed for a stranger. On 1 May, he run one last rainy day, ditch the beeper, and leave. As an adult than before, I will also never look at that canned pineapple again.
